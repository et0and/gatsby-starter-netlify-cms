_The Old Guitarist_ was painted in 1903-1904, just after the suicide of Picasso's close friend Carlos Casagemas. During this period, the artist was sympathetic to the plight of the downtrodden and painted many canvases depicting the miseries of the poor, the ill, and those cast out of society. This era of Picasso's work is known as "Blue Period", works made during a time when Picasso himself was rather downtrodden and struggling both emotionally and financially.
